# 💫 About Me:
An artificial intelligence student. Interested in how intelligent systems work, how they learn, think, and assist people in real-life situations. I believe Al is not just about technology, but about making life better, safer, and more human. I'm learning the main ideas behind AI and how machines can understand and support human goals. For me, AI is a way to connect humans and machines in a helpful and meaningful way. Real intelligence, human or artificial, is most powerful when it's guided by kindness, ethics, and purpose. I'm here to grow, learn, and one day, make a positive impact in the field. I'm always looking for new learning opportunities and open to connecting with others who share the same passion for AI and technology.
